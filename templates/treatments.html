    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Treatment for brain tumors depends on several factors including the type, size, location of the tumor, and the patient's overall health. A combination of therapies is often used for better outcomes. This page outlines the most common treatment options.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Treatment Methods</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Surgery:</strong> Surgical removal of the tumor is often the first step when accessible and safe. It helps reduce tumor size and relieve pressure.</li>
      <li><strong>Radiation Therapy:</strong> Uses high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells or shrink tumors. Common after surgery or when surgery isn’t an option.</li>
      <li><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> Drug therapy used to kill tumor cells, typically delivered orally or intravenously.</li>
      <li><strong>Targeted Therapy:</strong> Drugs that target specific genes or proteins that contribute to cancer growth.</li>
      <li><strong>Immunotherapy:</strong> Boosts the body's natural defenses to fight cancer using substances made by the body or in a lab.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Supportive & Palliative Care</h2>
    <p>
      Treatments may also include palliative care to improve quality of life — managing symptoms like seizures, pain, fatigue, and emotional distress. Rehabilitation services such as physical, occupational, and speech therapy may be part of the recovery process.
